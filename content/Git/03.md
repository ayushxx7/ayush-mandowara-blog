<h3>PURPOSE</h3>
If you have multiple accounts on your machine, chances are you end up making commits from the wrong author in a repository. 
To avoid having to change it afterwards, which is possible (Read: 02-How-to-Change-Author), follow these simple steps.

1. Open Terminal.

2. Change the current working directory to your local project.

Note: Make sure you are in the root directory, i.e., the directory containing [.git] folder.

3. Open the <b>.git\config</b> file for the repository.

```
gvim .git\config
```

4. Enter the following:

```
[user]
        name = Ayush Mandowara -- name of the author
        email = example@email.com -- git email of the author
        username = ayushxx7 -- git username of the author
[remote "origin"]
	url = https://user_name:password@github.com/ayushxx7/ayush-mandowara-blog -- url of the repository.
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[branch "master"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/master
```

5. Hit Save and you're done.

<h4> Some Points to Note about the config file changes </h4>

  - You especially need the [user] block to do what this post is for the rest is all optional.
  - Adding a URL like shared in the above file will help in never having to enter credentials for Git again.
  - However, at the same time, this is not very safe, and you should only do this if it's your personal machine.

<h3> I have not experimented with multiple branches for this specifically, when I do, I will update how the file will look like for such a scenario </h3>
