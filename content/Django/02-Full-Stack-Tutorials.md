## PURPOSE

To share a collection of tutorials that I found useful and worth sharing

### [Full Stack React & Django](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uyei2iDA4Hs)

- Difficulty Level: HARD
- Length: 7-Part series (~40 minutes/lecture)

#### What will you learn?

- Making your React App live inside your Django app (so they are both hosted on the same port)
- Using high level tools such as Django-Rest-Framework & Redux that are complex to get, but adhere to good practices by default

#### Who is it for?

- People who have some experience in both Django & React, but absolute can follow along (Framework-wise) as well.
