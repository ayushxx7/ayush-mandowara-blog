# Notes from Live Session
Data is the new oil

# Impact
## Impact on Banking
- Querying the data is huge problem for Banking. Here, ML, AI, Data Analytics is used. - Banking

## Impact on Retail - Snapdeal
- Data Science has moved to central role from support role

## Impact on IT Industry
How things have changed over time in Analytics
   - what happened (descriptive) 
   - how it happened (inferential) 
   - what will happen (predictive) 
   - how we can make it happen (prescriptive) 

- Cloud Modernisation - https://www.snowflake.com/

## Impact on Retail - BigBasket
- Retail customers want
   - great range
   - convenience
   - price
- Not all customers will focus on all three things at all times. It depends on the situation and timing.
- Personalization is not a new concept, just that number of customers is huge now.
- The repetitive process should be as simple and quick as possible so that customer can spend time on discovery.


# Data Element - What exactly is it used for

## Healthcare
- medical record is dense
- try to make patients life better
- advance research
- finding doctor and information
- onboarding data points
- understanding data we already have

## Finance
varies from client to client 

- retail
   - spend behavior for retail
   - savings not that important
   - spend should happen from your app.

- broking house
   - trade data, portfolio

   - consumer behavior
   - risk fraud detection (KML)

- banking is complete tech driven
- AR (Augment Reality) is being used in Banking a lot

## Retail - Snapdeal
difficult to point out one specific data point
- customer experience
- repeating customer
- how much time does user spends - recommendation model (#1)
- negotiate with sellers and customers
- price optimization - pricing model (#2)
- delivery - predictive model
- image processing - de-duplications

## Information Technology and Services
- client doesn't come up with tech spec
- most important is domain experience, then followed by technology
- harmonize the data so that data can be used by anyone
- self-service
- UI/UX
- what am I able to understand through the dashboard

- writing code is important to improve brain
- determination 
   - how much you want to learn
   - don't compare with peers
   - What you want to achieve in life
   - What have I learned today?
- don't stop learning
- have to be realistic when switching jobs
- open minded
- keeping mind sharp
- learn core skill set and enough different skill sets to know what will work
