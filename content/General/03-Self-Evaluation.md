#Rating myself 5/5 with reason (150 world limit)

##Technical / Domain Competence
built robust & scalable full-stack apps, testing frameworks, scripts, and APIs. Learned all the tools quickly (Vim, Git. Shell scripting etc.). In depth knowledge of Py/JS/Flask/Django/PyTest/APIs/frontend-frameworks etc. Followed best practices and refactored existing codebase whenever possible.

##Productivity and Quality â€“ Getting things done and with good quality.
I had a very stronghold in the planning/requirement gathering phase (Networking w/ different teams, gaining insight, understanding the problem properly) which helped in keeping the projects streamlined. Minimal changes + better tooling + strong commitment => speedy delivery of high quality code.

##Teamwork
solved problems that my teammates were having by systematically debugging them step-by-step. Helped in automating mundane/repeated tasks. Shared my customizations/thoughts/techniques whenever I learned something new which could be used by others. Shared workload whenever such an opportunity arose.

##Initiative
Devoted countless hours in R&D while keeping up with deadlines as what I learn today will certainly help me (& the team) tomorrow. Took up challenging tasks & solved problems that required enormous amounts of concentration. Focused on acquiring new skills to deliver several POCs in record time.

##Innovation
Created frameworks from scratch, deployed projects that were previously thought to be impossible (or very hard) to implement. Improved existing workflows by taking a deeper look at the legacy codebase. Shared multiple Insightful suggestions that ultimately get integrated in the system.

##Communication
I have been extremely efficient in communicating intent both via written (email/commit messages/PRs) and spoken mediums. Having an inquisitive mind, I always listened to my colleagues carefully, understanding their requirements or suggestions, thereby consistently choosing the best way forward.

##Flexibility
Worked on several projects that involved a wide range of technologies as well interacting with various members of different teams. Altered my daily schedule (longer hours, sleepless nights) as per the requirements and deadlines of ongoing projects without fail. I was on-call 24x7 everday.
