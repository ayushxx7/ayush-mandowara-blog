# Adyen
Digital Payments are a thing of the future and Adyen is a global leader in the field. I also admire the one system, one process, one contract approach that Adyen has, be it a brick-and-mortar business, or online, or both. I believe having someone with a strong foundation in fundamental concepts of programming, a knack for learning, a vast range of projects under his belt, a sharp focus, and someone who exhibits leadership qualities would be a good fit for an organization such as Adyen.

# Algolia

Hi Zaviear,

Artificial Intelligence combined with Search is one of the greatest things to be ever invented by mankind, and to do it as well as Algolia does is remarkable. I also admire the open-source tools and APIs it provides. Moreover, I have experienced the speed of the service first hand as my team uses Zendesk for their support needs, which in turn uses Algolia at their backend.

I believe having someone with a strong foundation in fundamental concepts of programming, a knack for learning, a vast range of projects under his belt, a sharp focus, and someone who exhibits leadership qualities would be a good fit for an organization such as Adyen.

Give me any challenge to solve, and I'll prove my worth to you.

CANDOR - Ability to receive and give constructive feedback
CARE - Genuine care about other team members, our clients and the decisions we make in the company

# Github

Why you want to work at Github?
I visit GitHub every day. It's the place to be for anyone who wants to keep a version history of their work be it development, keeping notes, blogs, and anything else. I understand that all of these are features of `Git`, but Github makes it trivially easy to do many of these things. It would be an honor working at the OG Open Source solution for all.

Why do you feel fit for role?
I believe having someone with a strong foundation in fundamental concepts of programming, a knack for learning, a vast range of projects under his belt, a sharp focus, and someone who exhibits leadership qualities would be a good fit for an organization such as Github.

Give me any challenge to solve, and I'll prove my worth to you.

# DeepSync

Hi Ishaan,

I think what you and the team are doing with Deepsync is simply remarkable. I am one of those people who would rather listen to some music audio while doing some form of exercise such as walking (yes, walking for more than an hour can feel like exercise). I often wonder if there was a way for me to gain knowledge while I walk, and the only solution I can think of is using headphones and listening to a podcast. The only problem is, there aren't many podcasts out there, and part of the reason is that Videos are more interactive, and the other part is because creating content in itself is hard. I think that having a platform such as yours will help people a lot for the second scenario. All of this to say, that I believe in the product, and I believe that I can be a good fit for the company too.

I believe having someone with a strong foundation in fundamental concepts of programming, a knack for learning, a vast range of projects under his belt, a sharp focus, and someone who exhibits leadership qualities would be a good fit for an organization such as yours.

I have an unpublished paper in the field of AI, specifically Game Playing AI. I learned about things like alpha-beta cut-off, and how we can use techniques such as unsupervised learning & reinforcement learning to make the computer train itself.
I have another one in ML, where I created a Phone Recommendation system using Sentiment Analysis as a base feeder.
In the past, I have created several automation projects, most of them using Python. They are listed on my Github.

Give me any challenge to solve, and I'll prove my worth to you.

# My Response:
Hi Rahul,

I am a passionate engineer who has a reputation for getting things done quickly while keeping high QOC. Part of the speed + accuracy comes from my extensive investment of time in improving my tooling (.vimrc, git, shell scripting), while the rest of it is simply because I have strong fundamentals and enjoy working at hard problems that take enormous concentration. I try to jump in and help my teammates whenever possible, and even inspire them to incorporate better habits while writing code. Working in a startup, I have learned the importance of quickly iterating through multiple POCs and selecting the best way forward. An ability to incorporate the many changes that a project might go through, with minimal delay, is what makes me a good pick for the position.

I believe having someone with a strong foundation in fundamental concepts of programming, a knack for learning, a vast range of projects under his belt, a sharp focus, and someone who exhibits leadership qualities would be a good fit for an organization such as yours.

To prove my skillset, I'm willing to solve any challenge or assignment that you have.

# Emittr --- this one is basically all that I did these past two years except for the JS Part xD

Why apply?

To become jack of all trades along with master of one. Everyone in the team talks to customers so they can empathize with them better. So apart from developing good engineer skills you will also get to wear multiple other hats.
We do not differentiate between roles like software engineer, data scientist, data analyst etc as we believe they are just different names of an engineer and a good engineer with a super power of learning things fast can do anything. So being a founding member you will get to work on different fields at times.
We work on trending and scalable technologies along with using good engineering practices while building things. So an opportunity to get to work on that.
About the platform:
Emitrr is a 24/7 backup receptionist for small businesses globally. We are changing the way people communicate with the small businesses.

Requirements:

Bachelor's/Masters or PhD degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Statistics or related discipline is NOT MANDATORY. Skills and passion to build product that people love is mandatory. :)
Eager to learn new things and motivated to work in the conversational AI space.
Strong proficiency in JavaScript, including DOM manipulation and the JavaScript object model
Knowledge of Node.js and frameworks available for it {{such as Express, StrongLoop, etc depending on your technology stack}}
Good understanding of React.js and its core principles with experience with working on popular React.js workflows (such as Flux or Redux) is a plus
Familiarity with RESTful APIs
Having an experience of working on NLP engines like Rasa, wit.ai, dialogflow, etc. is a plus
Minimum 1 year experience is preferred. (We also love people who have prior experience of starting up on their own)


# Emittr
Hi Pulkit,

One of my core projects this year has been integrating a Conversational AI solution that uses DialogFlow at its core into the BlueStacks App Player. I have a stronghold on Python and Javascript (React/Redux/Vanilla JS) and both of these helped in quickly scaling the application and adding features such as limiting the number of open conversations any agent will receive and providing an automated tagging solution based on scenarios such as when the agent does not reply on time during Live Chat.
I have even worked as a customer support representative (email-based) for a short time to truly grasp the inner workings of the field. Eventually, I was preparing tools for the team that would help them to focus on the customers while the system can take care of providing the necessary abstractions. General Purpose scripting is a suit that I wear with pride, and it's truly a game-changer when it comes to improving the quality of work that we do. Recently, I have also developed a full-stack web app with Django on the backend, and React-Redux on the frontend. I truly grasped the power of the react-redux combination because of it, since the scope of this App is massive.

I believe having someone with a strong foundation in fundamental concepts of programming, a knack for learning, a vast range of projects under his belt, a sharp focus, and someone who exhibits leadership qualities would be a good fit for an organization such as yours.

I am willing to solve any assignments that you give me to prove my worth.

Why you would be good fit? (Asked in survey by Emittr)
Here's my tech blog: https://ayush-blog.netlify.app/ & corresponding Github: https://github.com/ayushxx7/ayush-mandowara-blog. I mostly write about the challenges I faced during the day (ex: If I looked up how to do "X", there's a chance I will end up writing the solution as part of a blog post).

I have a strong hold on Vim (have a custom .vimrc: https://github.com/ayushxx7/dotfiles), Git (can use interactive rebase), and other tools such as GSheets, Google BigQuery.

I've been coding in Python for 4+ years (1.5 years as a full-time employee, did a bit of freelancing, internships, and some other personal projects).

I also understand JS (have integrated a live chat solution on the support page of BlueStacks, customized zendesk search, autogenerated popular section in Help Center etc.).
I have created a dashboard using React.js+Redux combination (learned everything from scratch) and implemented a solution in record time.

Some of my projects:
- facebook autoliker: https://github.com/ayushxx7/Facebook-Auto-Liker

# Rocket Learning

Hi Siddhant,

I am inspired by what your organization aims to do. Not many step up to the tasks involving helping people at scale, especially those from the weaker sections of society. I would love to make an impact myself and given my skillset for the past 5 years (2 years professionally) has been developed in Python (scripts, tests, full-stack apps, automation, APIs, data analysis), I would be a great fit.

I believe having someone with a strong foundation in fundamental concepts of programming, a knack for learning, a vast range of projects under his belt, a sharp focus, and someone who exhibits leadership qualities would be a good fit for an organization such as yours.

Give me a test, and I promise I will pass with flying colors.

- Ability to self-manage and work autonomously in a collaborative environment

- A focus on detail including automated tests and documentation

- Good in analyzing and solving problems

### My Answer

Hi Edul,

I have a stronghold on Python(Flask/Django/Django Rest Framework) and Javascript (React/Redux/Vanilla JS) and both of these helped in quickly scaling various applications that the company uses internally.
General Purpose scripting is a suit that I wear with pride, and it's truly a game-changer when it comes to improving the quality of work that we do.
Recently, I have also developed a full-stack web app with Django on the backend, and React-Redux on the frontend. I truly grasped the power of the react-redux combination since the scope of the project was massive.

What do I bring to the table?
- I am a passionate engineer who has a reputation for getting things done quickly while keeping high QOC.
Part of the speed + accuracy comes from my extensive investment of time in improving my tooling (.vimrc, git, shell scripting), while the rest of it is simply because I have strong fundamentals and enjoy working at hard problems that take enormous concentration.

# LimeChat

Hi Nikhil,

The problem you are trying to solve is indeed something that excites me as a developer as well as a consumer. I've joined groups on Telegram that help me spot deals (huge discounts, pricing errors, what have you) I would otherwise miss, and it's a treat!
I've worked on live chat solutions, automation, testing, internal tooling, among other things. Python is my language of choice (4 years and counting), while I am also comfortable with Javascript.

I would love the opportunity to share with you why I might be a great fit for the LimeChat team. Looking forward to hearing from you!

Regards,
Ayush
