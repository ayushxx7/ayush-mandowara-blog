# Power Communication
Listen Better, Influence Better

## 4 Power Listening Tools
- Manage conflicts better
- Become a better persuader

## Ask
### Strategy 
- show genuine concern and open mindset to know more

- Invite them to express themselves
- Break an awkward silence and shyness
### Examples

## Mirror
### Strategy
- Mirror the observation

- Our tone of voice should make them comfortable

- Use curiosity and observation and not judgement

### Examples

## Paraphrase
### Strategy
- Paraphrasing to create additional safety
- Makes the other person feel understood

### Approach
- Repeating the message in a shorter form and in our own words
- Remain calm and collected
- Don't push too hard and take it slow and pace yourself

### Examples
- Allow me to share what I understand, you would like to stop working on this project?
- Have I captured it correctly?

## Prime
### Strategy
Offer your best guess at what the other person is thinking or feeling, before you expect them to do the same
Useful for Awkward silence

### Approach
- an act of good faith, taking risks, becoming vulnerable and building safetly
- This helps in others sharing the meaning

### Examples
- Are you finding these points I just shared, a bit confusing?
- Would you need more time to process this?
- Can I clarify or share more information?
