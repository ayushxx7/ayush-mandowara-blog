# Myth vs Reality

| Myth                                                 | Reality                             |
|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| You need an expensive resume writer                  | You need custom resume for each job |
| Your resume will be read by the HR Manager           | Applicant Tracking Systems          |
| Your entire professional history should be mentioned | What's in it for me? WIIFM          |
| Responsibilities                                     | Focus only on achievements          |
| A resume is a document                               | A resume is your marketing brochure |
|                                                      | Resumes are scanned, not read       |

# Tips
- Aim for high-keyword match
- craft your resume from the HR Manager's perspective, not yours
- Instead of "I was responsible for client acquisitions", write "I acquired 3 clients in 6 months who contribute to 5% incremental revenue."
- replace all responsibilities with achievements
- Don't sell the bacon. Sell the sizzle!
