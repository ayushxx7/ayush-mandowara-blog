- learned and improved upon my tooling everyday (Vim, Git. Shell scripting etc.).
- In depth knowledge of Py/JS/Flask/Django/PyTest/APIs/frontend-frameworks etc.
- followed best practices and refactored existing codebase whenever possible.

### Productivity and Quality â€“ Getting things done and with good quality.

- very stronghold in the planning/requirement gathering phase
  - Networking w/ different teams
  - gaining insight
  - understanding the problem properly
- helped in keeping the projects streamlined
- combined with better tooling and a strong commitment, consistently delivery high quality code quickly

### Teamwork

- solved problems that my teammates were having by systematically debugging them step-by-step.
- improved workflows for Vim/Git
- automated mundane/repeated tasks (batch/py scripts)
- shared my customizations/thoughts/techniques
- shared workload whenever such an opportunity arose.

### Initiative

- devoted countless hours in R&D while keeping up with deadlines as what I learn today will certainly help me (& the team) tomorrow.
- took up challenging tasks & solved problems that required enormous amounts of concentration.
- focused on acquiring new skills to deliver several POCs in record time.

### Innovation

- created frameworks from scratch
- deployed projects that were previously thought to be impossible (or very hard) to implement.

- shared multiple Insightful suggestions that ultimately get integrated in the system.

### Communication

- extremely efficient in communicating intent both via written (email/commit messages/PRs) and spoken mediums.
- Having an inquisitive mind, I always listened to my colleagues carefully, understanding their requirements or suggestions, thereby consistently choosing the best way forward.

### Flexibility
