The following are the 5 qualities of a great software engineer

1. They take their work very seriously and consistently perform on the highest level
2. They aspire to improve their skills
3. Cleanliness - If the restaurant doesn't look clean, the food isn't going to taste good
4. Impatience - They are not prone to collaboration. They're stubborn and insist on having things their own way.
   Now, this is not necessarily a good thing to be stubborn, but how else will you become a `BDFL`!
   What ties these attributes together, is
5. Passion

That's what makes a great Software Engineer.

Someone who has these qualities will sometimes be referred to as a `Perfectionist`, and rightly so.

These principles can be applied to other fields as well.

The original idea came from this movie: [Jiro Dreams of Sushi](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1772925/). One of the qualities could also be that a good Software Developer knows how to copy and paste stuff effectively ;)
