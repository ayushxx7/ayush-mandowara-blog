The following are the 5 qualities of a great software engineer
1. They take their work very seriously and consistently perform on the highest level
2. They aspire to improve their skills
3. Cleanliness - If the restaurant doesn't look clean, the food isn't going to taste good
4. Impatience - They are not prone to collaboration. They're stubborn and insist on having things their own way.
What ties these attributes together, is
5. Passion
That's what makes a great Software Engineer.

Someone who has these qualities will sometimes be referred to as a `Perfectionist`, and rightly so.
