# About Me

I am a passionate software engineer who lives inside the terminal for most of the day by choice.   

I enjoy solving complex problems related to 
- software design
- development
- testing

I am known for 
- taking initiatives
- having innovative ideas
- excellent communication skills
- immense dedication

I prefer quality over quantity but I understand that the market we are in demands extremely fast results. This is why I spend much of my free time in improving my toolkit, and sharpening my brain through practical learning.  

I like learning new things and sharing the knowledge that I acquire with as many people as possible.   

# Work Experience
I have 3+ years of working professionally as a Python developer.  

I can build 
- Web Apps/REST APIs using Flask, Django & React.js
- Sophisticated scripts and tools using Python

# Journey
I have always been interested in computers since I was little. I ended up choosing C++ during my schooling years, and loved every minute of it. Eventually, I switched to Python in college and ended up creating some awesome projects such as Auto File Renamer, Zipfs law verification, Facebook Auto liker and a couple of websites. I did a bit of freelancing in college, writing general purpose scripts using Python. I did an internship at Aam Aadmi Party, where I was leading a team of two, did some data analysis and built a couple of social media bots.  
I currently work at BlueStacks, where I build internal tools, apps and test suites in my day-to-day job. I have made a name for myself as someone who can deliver scalable, & robust projects in record time.

# Personal Growth
I write my thoughts over my blog: https://ayush-blog.netlify.app.  
I have built a couple of social media (FB/Twitter/Whatsapp) bots as personal projects.  
I have hands on experience with data science libraries such as pandas & numpy.  
I have acquired a beginner certification in Pandas.  
I am pursuing a Master's degree in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.  
I try to push at least one commit every day to Github: github.com/ayushxx7.

# Statement
I automate to help free up business teams from working on mundane, repetitive tasks, allowing them to learn new technical skills and accelerating their contribution to their organization's growth and success by engaging in high-value activities & innovation
