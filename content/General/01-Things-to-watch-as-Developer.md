### Introduction
As a software developer, we have a ton of responsibilities.
- Finish your tasks on time
- Maintain a strict routine
- Never extend your deadlines
- Always be cheerful, no matter how much pressure you feel on yourself. Afterall, the work can be done by anyone, what matters is your behavior/attitude towards your work and coworkers.
- Stay up to date with the latest and greatest
- Keep building side projects or you will loose that edge
- Just keep grinding, day-in, day-out.

In this rush, we sometimes forget some of the core principles and reasons why we ended up choosing this field of work in the first place.

To that end, I am listing below a variety of videos that you should watch, to be develop better software, employ better coding practices, and be a good engineer in general.
