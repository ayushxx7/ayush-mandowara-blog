# Purpose
Companies usually collect a lot of data over time. Once they have enough data, they realize, they can't do much with it.  
They come in contact with a Data Scientist, and say:  
Here's some data, we don't know how to use it. Do something with it. 
In other words, here's some data, please perform your magic. you are a data scientist, right?

# What is EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis, or EDA in short, is a process of understanding data and identifying insights and patterns from it.

# Types of Analysis
## Univariate analysis
## Bivariate analysis


### Question: Which Industry would you like to explore? Why? Where would get the data from?
I would like to analyze the Gaming Industry (both PC & Mobile). The reason is I am currently working in the gaming industry itself. 
The data I can collect from Steam, Discord, Android App Store, iOS App Store. 
- steam will give me ratings + reviews + prices
- discord can potentially give me how active the community is
- twitch could also be a valid source for finding which games are relevant
- I will also look for publicly available datasets through web search, and scanning github for datasets

## Words of Wisdom
To come up with any relevant insight, a person who has more understanding of the business domain will have a better answer than someone who doesn't. So, it is important to understand the industry.  
Not everyone who has data will know what to do with it. Hence, it is important for the data scientist to perform some EDA to understand the data at hand before proceeding with business requirements.   
There is a host of public data available, and one must practice their skills on these datasets from time to time. Not only will it sharpen the axe, but also help us know what kind of data is available to use.  

# What is Big Data?
Big Data - Mess which I don't understand. 
In other words, there is so much data, that it can't be used directly. We need to identifying important features, do some slicing & dicing operations, select the relevant subset of data and then analyze it to get some meaningful insights from it.
