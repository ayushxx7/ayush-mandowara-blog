# Random Variable
- which maps the output of a random experiment to a numerical value
- Radom Experiment Example: tossing a coin

# Expected Value
- average value of radom variable in the long run
- $\displaystyle E(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{N}P(x_{i})\times x_{i}$

# Probability
- sum of all probabilities in an experiment is equal to 1

# Inferential Statistics
- It is difficult to read the behavior of the complete population due to time and cost issue
- We can use inferential statistics where we infer information about population from sample
- Example: Lead content in Maggi Packets

# Central Limit Theorem
- Sampling distribution mean is the mean of sample means
- Number of units in every sample is called sample size

1. The sampling distribution Mean = Population Mean
    - $\mu_s = \mu_p$
2. Standard Error = $\sigma_p = \frac{\mu_s}{\sqrt n}$
3. If $n>30$, sammpling distribution is assumed to be normally distributed

# Confidence Interval
$\mu \pm \frac{Z^*\sigma}{\sqrt n}$

# Hypothesis Testing
- Hypothesis: A claim or an assumption \thetaat we make about one or more population parameters
- Types of Hypothesis:
    - Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)
        - makes an asummption about the status quo
        - always contains the symbols $=, \leq, \geq$
    - Alternate Hypothesis ($H_1$)
        - challenges and complements the null hypothesis
        - always contains the symbols $\neq, <, >$
- $H_0 \& H_1$ are disjoint events

# Upper Tailed Test
- The critical region lies on the right side of the distribution
- The alternate hypothesis contains &lt; symbol
- If alpha is 0.5, p-value = 0.95

# Lower Tailed Test
- The critical region lies on the left side of the distribution
- The alternate hypothesis contains &gt; symbol
- If alpha is 0.5, p-value = 0.05

# Two Tailed Test
- The critical region lies on both sides of the distribution
- The alternate hypothesis contains $\neq$ symbol
- If alpha is 0.5, p-value range (cumulative over sections): [0, 0.025, 50, 0.975, 1]

# Exploratory Data Analysis
- Types of Data
    - Public Data: data collected by the government or other public agencies that are made public for the purposes of research are known as Public data
    - Private Data: Data generated by Banking, telecom, retail and media are some examples of private data. This data cannot be used freely for analysis

- Univariate
    - Analyzing one variable at a time
    - historgram, countrplot, boxplot
- Bivariate
    - Analyzing two variables at a time
    - scatterplot, barplot, boxplot, pairplot
- Multivariate
    - Analyzing more than two variables at a time
    - barplot, scatterplot, boxplot
- Outlier Analysis

- Categorical Data 
    - discrete values

- Continuous Data
    - range of values

# Linear Regression
- It is the simplest form of regression. It is a technique in which the **dependent variable is continuous** in nature. The **relationship** between the dependent variable and independent variables is assumed to be **linear** in nature.
- Simple Linear Regression - one independent variable
- Multiple Linear Regression - more than one independent variable

# $R^2$ 
- Out of total variance how much is explained by the model
- $\displaystyle \frac{1 - RSS}{TSS}$

# RSS 
- how much target value varies around the regression line
- $\displaystyle Error = \sum_{i=1}^{N}(Actual - Predicted)^2$

# Adjusted $R^2$ 
$Adj R^2 = 1 - \frac{(1-R^2)(N-1)}{(N-P-1)}$
- contains effect of data size
- N = Number of Rows
- P = number of Features

# Logistic Regression
- Sigmoid Curve ranges from 0 to 1
- Log Odds = $\displaystyle \ln\frac{P}{1-P} = \beta_0+\beta_1x_{i}$
- Odds = $\displaystyle \frac{P}{1-P}$

# Naive Bayes
- based on Bayes theorem
- $\displaystyle P(A|G) = \frac{P(G|A)\times P(A)}{P(G)}$
- $\displaystyle P(y|(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)) = \frac{\prod_{i=1}^{N}P(x_i|y)\times P(y)}{\prod_{i=1}^{N}P(x_i)}$


# Important Topics
- Expected Values
- Mean, Median, Mode
- Probability
- CLT
- $H_0, H_1$ hypothesis formulation
- EDA graph based questions
- R^2, Adj R^2, y=mx+c
- odds: $\displaystyle y = \frac{1}{1+e^{-\beta_0+\beta_1x_1}}$
- sigmoid
- recall, precision, specificity, sensitivity, confusion matrix
